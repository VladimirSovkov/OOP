The tanks are divided into two groups: main and special. The main tanks are designed to 
solve the main combat tasks. They combine high mobility, security and firepower. Special 
tanks are tanks designed for special combat missions (for example, light floating).

Tankman is a military profession. Tanks were invented not very long ago. They are less than 
a hundred years. But now it is one of the main military vehicles. Strong armor protects the 
tank from enemy projectiles. Each tank has a gun. Work at the tank very difficult. In the 
tank there is cramped, stuffy and very shaky. The engine keeps crashing. The tank is a 
complex machine. The whole crew works in the tank: the commander, the mechanic, the shooter 
and the radio operator.
